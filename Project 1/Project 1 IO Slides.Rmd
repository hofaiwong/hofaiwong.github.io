## Overview

- How does a restaurant's location, cuisine type or timing of inspection affect it's health inspection results? E.g:
- Are restaurants in Manhattan cleaner than those in Queens or the Bronx?
- Do Chinese/Asian restaurants have poorer hygiene than French or American restaurants?
- Are summer inspections associated with worse health results?
